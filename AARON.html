<p1>
    In my final years of Presec,i met many mentors who encouraged,dazzled  and inspired me 
    to venture into fields where I can only not help people in my environment,but also the world at large.
    Also a field where there is always more to learn to improve the standard og living of people around me.
    Also,people around have informed me of how lucreative this field can be and can be rometly  to facilitate effective and efficient work.
